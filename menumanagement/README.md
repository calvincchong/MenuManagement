## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

the `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. files in this directory are treated as [api routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of react pages.

this project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load inter, a custom google font.
